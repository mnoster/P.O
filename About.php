        <h2>Purpose</h2>

        <p ><h2 class="fancy">A current problem in mental health research is that experiments are usually conducted in research institutions,
            such as universities. Many experiments consist of voluntary participants who sometimes are compensated for their time, which
            can be a confounding factor. A great deal of data is missing from these representative samples, chiefly those who are actually affected
            by mental health conditions.
        </h2>
        </p>
        <p ><h2 class="fancy">With this application, we wish to appropriately aggregate information from actual mental health patients and use it to
            generate better information so that researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and curious minds have access to more representative data.

                The PsychOrigins.com search engine is built with Microsoft Academic Knowledge Database, which provides access to hundreds of thousands of research articles.
                We are always looking into expanding the amount of research available and will soon be incorporating BioMed Central database access.
