# Psych Origins
#
PsychOrigins.com is a tool for licensed mental health clinicians and those in the field of research.
It provides a readily updated and organized documentation of current trends within the mental health field.
#
A current problem in mental health research is that experiments are usually conducted in research institutions,
 such as universities. Furthermore, many experiments consist of voluntary participants and sometimes are compensated for their time, which
can be a confounding factor. A great deal of data is missing from these representative samples, chiefly those who are actually affected
 by mental health conditions.
#
With this application, we wish to appropriately aggregate information from actual mental health patients and use it to
 generate better information so that researchers, pharmaceutical companies, and curious minds have access to more representative data.
