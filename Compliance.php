        <h2>Data safeguards</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>There are a number of things that a covered entity must do to safeguard Protected Health Information, some of
            which includes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Using a unique user ID for identifying and tracking (recording) user identity.</li>
            <li>Enabling automatic logoff procedures for computers that access and display Protected Health Information.
                The
                automatic logoff function ends a session upon detecting a predetermined amount of computer inactivity.
            </li>
            <li>Encrypting Protected Health Information</li>
            <li>Periodically checking for data tampering and/or unauthorized access to such data</li>
            <li>Implementing a data restoration (data recovery) program in the event of an emergency.</li>
            <li>Controlling access to Protected Health Information and the environment in which it’s housed (including
                computers and software programs).
            </li>
            <li>Documenting all employee, patient, and visitor activity related to the access, use, and/or disclosure of
                Protected Health Information.
            </li>
            <li>Establishing functions for all areas that contain PHI and ensuring those functions are performed.</li>
            <li>Monitoring and documenting the current location, removal of and final destination of all PHI</li>
            <li>Performing regular risk assessments, activity reviews, and sanctions (if required).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The full scope of requirements is provided in the HIPAA Regulations section of this course.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>When patient health information needs to be disclosed for research purposes, an agreement (informed consent
            document) must be signed by each participant and describe the study, anticipated risks and/or benefits, and
            the
            manner in which records will be protected. This agreement, too, must be written in plain language.</p>

        <h3>Limited data set</h3>
        <p>A limited data set is health information that excludes data that can be used to identify an individual. Data
            that
            can be used to identify an individual is called a “direct identifier.” Examples of direct identifiers are
            names,
            addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, social security numbers, insurance numbers, and more. A limited
            data
            set only uses city, state, ZIP code data and other types of information that cannot be used to identify a
            patient.<sup>1</sup></p>

            associate for such purpose, whether or not the limited data set is to be used by the covered entity.

        <p>(ii) <strong>Contents</strong>. A data use agreement between the covered entity and the limited data set
            recipient must:
        </p>

        <p>(A) Establish the permitted uses and disclosures of such information by the limited data set recipient,
            consistent with paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The data use agreement may not authorize the limited data

            data use agreement;
        </p>

        <p>(3) Report to the covered entity any use or disclosure of the information not provided for by its data use
            agreement of which it becomes aware;

        <p>(iii) <strong>Compliance</strong>.</p>

        <p>(A) A covered entity is not in compliance with the standards in paragraph (e) of this section if the covered
            entity knew of a pattern of activity or practice of the limited data set recipient that constituted a
            material
            breach or violation of the data use agreement, unless the covered entity took reasonable steps to cure the
            breach or end the violation, as applicable, and, if such steps were unsuccessful:
        </p>

        <p>(1) Discontinued disclosure of protected health information to the recipient; and</p>

        <p>(2) Reported the problem to the Secretary.</p>
