        <h2>Patient rights</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Under HIPAA, patients have the following rights:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>To access, copy and inspect their own health information;</li>
            <li>To request an amendment or correction to existing information;</li>
            <li>To collect an accounting of certain disclosures;</li>
            <li>To request restrictions on disclosures for treatment and/or payment of health care;</li>
            <li>To request alternative communications methods; and</li>
            <li>To complain about violations and/or a covered entity’s own policies.</li>

        <h2>Data safeguards</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>There are a number of things that a covered entity must do to safeguard Protected Health Information, some of
            which includes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Using a unique user ID for identifying and tracking (recording) user identity.</li>
            <li>Enabling automatic logoff procedures for computers that access and display Protected Health Information.
                The
                automatic logoff function ends a session upon detecting a predetermined amount of computer inactivity.
            </li>
            <li>Encrypting Protected Health Information</li>
            <li>Periodically checking for data tampering and/or unauthorized access to such data</li>
            <li>Implementing a data restoration (data recovery) program in the event of an emergency.</li>
            <li>Controlling access to Protected Health Information and the environment in which it’s housed (including
                computers and software programs).
            </li>
            <li>Documenting all employee, patient, and visitor activity related to the access, use, and/or disclosure of
                Protected Health Information.
            </li>
            <li>Establishing functions for all areas that contain PHI and ensuring those functions are performed.</li>
            <li>Monitoring and documenting the current location, removal of and final destination of all PHI</li>
            <li>Performing regular risk assessments, activity reviews, and sanctions (if required).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The full scope of requirements is provided in the HIPAA Regulations section of this course.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>When patient health information needs to be disclosed for research purposes, an agreement (informed consent
            document) must be signed by each participant and describe the study, anticipated risks and/or benefits, and
            the
            manner in which records will be protected. This agreement, too, must be written in plain language.</p>

        <h3>Limited data set</h3>
        <p>A limited data set is health information that excludes data that can be used to identify an individual. Data
            that
            can be used to identify an individual is called a “direct identifier.” Examples of direct identifiers are
            names,
            addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, social security numbers, insurance numbers, and more. A limited
            data
            set only uses city, state, ZIP code data and other types of information that cannot be used to identify a
            patient.<sup>1</sup></p>

        <h2>Research Data Usage agreement</h2>
        <hr>
        <p><strong>The following is a sample data use agreement for research purposes.</strong></p>

        <p>AUTHORIZATION TO USE OR DISCLOSE (RELEASE) HEALTH INFORMATION THAT IDENTIFIES YOU FOR A RESEARCH STUDY</p>

        <p>If you sign this document, you give permission to [name or other identification of specific health care
            provider(s) or description of classes of persons, e.g., all doctors, all health care providers] at [name of
            covered entity or covered entities] to use or disclose (release) your health information that identifies you
            for
            the research study described here:</p>

        <p>[Provide a description of the research study, such as the title and purpose of the research.]</p>

        <p>The health information that we may use or disclose (release) for this research includes [complete as
            appropriate]:</p>

        <p>[Provide a description of information to be used or disclosed for the research project. This may include, for
            example, all information in a medical record, results of physical examinations, medical history, lab tests,
            or
            certain health information indicating or relating to a particular condition.]</p>

        <p>The health information listed above may be used by and/or disclosed (released) to:</p>

        <p>[Name or class of persons involved in the research; i.e., researchers and their staff]</p>

        <p>[Name of covered entity] is required by law to protect your health information. By signing this document, you
            authorize [name of covered entity] to use and/or disclose (release) your health information for this
            research.
            Those persons who receive your health information may not be required by Federal privacy laws (such as the
            Privacy Rule) to protect it and may share your information with others without your permission, if permitted
            by
            laws governing them.</p>

        <p>Where a covered entity conducts the research study, the Authorization must list ALL names or other
            identification, or ALL classes, of persons who will have access through the covered entity to the Protected
            Health Information (PHI) for the research study (e.g., research collaborators, sponsors, and others who will
            have access to data that includes PHI). Examples may include, but are not limited to the following:</p>

        <p>Data coordinating centers that will receive and process PHI;
            <br>
            Sponsors who want access to PHI or who will actually own the research data; and/or
            <br>
            Institutional Review Boards or Data Safety and Monitoring Boards.
        </p>

        <p>If the research study is conducted by a covered entity other than the covered entity, the authorization need
            only
            list the name or other identification of the outside researcher (or class of researchers) and any other
            covered
            entity to whom the covered entity is expected to make the disclosure.</p>

        <p>Please note that [include the appropriate statement]:</p>

        <p>You do not have to sign this Authorization, but if you do not, you may not receive research-related
            treatment.</p>

        <p>[Name of covered entity] may not condition (withhold or refuse) treating you on whether you sign this
            Authorization.</p>

        <p>Please note that [include the appropriate statement]:</p>

        <p>You may change your mind and revoke (take back) this Authorization at any time, except to the extent that
            [name
            of covered entity(ies)] has already acted based on this Authorization. To revoke this Authorization, you
            must
            write to: [name of the covered entity(ies) and contact information].</p>

        <p>You may change your mind and revoke (take back) this Authorization at any time. Even if you revoke this
            Authorization, [name or class of persons at the covered entity involved in the research] may still use or
            disclose health information they already have obtained about you as necessary to maintain the integrity or
            reliability of the current research. To revoke this Authorization, you must write to: [name of the covered
            entity(ies) and contact information].</p>

        <p>This Authorization does not have an expiration date [or as appropriate, insert expiration date or event, such
            as
            "end of the research study."]</p>
